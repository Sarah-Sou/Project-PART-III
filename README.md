Project Part III – Habit Tracker

This project is my Part III submission for INFR 3120. It is a backend-driven Habit Tracker built with Node.js, Express, EJS templates, and MongoDB Atlas. The goal of this project was to create a functional, secure, and fully deployed web application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete habits while maintaining a clean structure and reliable server-side logic.

I originally explored building an Angular frontend, but I decided to remove it to keep the project consistent with the backend setup. The application now runs as a complete server-rendered site using EJS, which keeps everything simple, stable, and easy to maintain.
